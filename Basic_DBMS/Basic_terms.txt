*Foreign keys can be NULL unless explicitly set to NOT NULL.

ðŸ”‘ 1. Primary Key
A unique identifier for each record in a table.

Cannot be NULL and must be unique.

âœ… Only one primary key per table.

Example:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Student (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

ðŸ”‘ 2. Candidate Key
A minimal set of attributes that can uniquely identify a row.

A table can have multiple candidate keys, but only one is chosen as the primary key.

Example:
In a table: student_id and email both uniquely identify a student.

Both are candidate keys.

One is selected as the primary key.

ðŸ”‘ 3. Alternate Key
The candidate keys that are not selected as the primary key.

Example:
plaintext
Copy code
Candidate Keys: student_id, email
Primary Key: student_id
Alternate Key: email

ðŸ”‘ 4. Foreign Key
A column that refers to the primary key in another table.

Used to maintain referential integrity between two tables.

Example:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
    enrollment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES Student(student_id)
);
ðŸ”‘ 5. Composite Key
A key made up of two or more columns that together uniquely identify a row.

Example:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
);
Neither student_id nor course_id alone is unique, but together they are.

ðŸ”‘ 6. Super Key
Any set of columns that uniquely identifies a row.

Includes primary key, composite key, and even larger combinations.

âœ… Every candidate key is a super key, but not every super key is minimal (so not a candidate key).

ðŸ”‘ 7. Surrogate Key
An artificial key (usually an auto-increment ID) created to uniquely identify records when natural keys are too complex or not available.

Example:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Product (
    product_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100)
);
product_id here is a surrogate key.

ðŸ”‘ 8. Unique Key
Ensures that all values in a column are unique, but unlike the primary key, it can contain NULLs.

Example:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
