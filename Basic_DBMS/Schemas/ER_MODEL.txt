                      ðŸ§  ENTITY-RELATIONSHIP (ER) MODEL
=======================================================================

ðŸ“Œ DEFINITION:
The **ER Model** is a high-level **conceptual data model** used to design 
database structures. It visually represents entities, their attributes, 
and the relationships among them.

=======================================================================
| Component       | Description                                            |
=======================================================================
| Entity          | A real-world object or concept (table)                |
| Attribute       | A property or detail of an entity (column)            |
| Relationship    | An association among entities                         |
| Primary Key     | Attribute(s) that uniquely identify each entity       |
| Cardinality     | Defines how many instances participate in a relationship |
=======================================================================

ðŸ“˜ TYPES OF ENTITIES:

| Type             | Description                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| Strong Entity    | Exists independently (has PK)      |
| Weak Entity      | Depends on another entity          |
| Associative Entity | Used in many-to-many relationships |
=======================================================================

ðŸŽ¯ ATTRIBUTE TYPES:

| Type             | Description                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Simple           | Atomic values (e.g., name, age)             |
| Composite        | Made up of multiple components (e.g., name â†’ fname, lname) |
| Derived          | Can be derived from other attributes (e.g., age from DOB) |
| Multivalued      | Can hold multiple values (e.g., phone numbers) |
=======================================================================

ðŸ”— RELATIONSHIP TYPES:

| Type            | Description                                 | Example               |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| One-to-One (1:1) | One entity relates to one of another        | Person â†” Passport      |
| One-to-Many (1:N)| One entity relates to many of another       | Department â†’ Student   |
| Many-to-Many (M:N)| Many entities relate to many others        | Student â†” Course       |
=======================================================================

ðŸ§¾ EXAMPLE: University ER Model

ENTITIES:
1. Student (student_id, name, dob)
2. Course (course_id, course_name, credits)
3. Department (dept_id, dept_name)
4. Enrollment (student_id, course_id, grade)

RELATIONSHIPS:
- Student ENROLLS in Course (M:N via Enrollment)
- Student BELONGS TO Department (M:1)
- Course OFFERED BY Department (M:1)

=======================================================================
ðŸ“Œ ER DIAGRAM NOTATION (Text Representation)

[STUDENT] -----<ENROLLS>----- [COURSE]
   |                             |
   +-- name                      +-- course_name
   +-- dob                       +-- credits

[STUDENT] ---(belongs to)---> [DEPARTMENT]
[COURSE]  ---(offered by)--->  [DEPARTMENT]

=======================================================================
âœ… WHY USE ER MODEL?

- Simplifies complex relationships
- Used before creating relational schema
- Helps normalize and plan database structures
