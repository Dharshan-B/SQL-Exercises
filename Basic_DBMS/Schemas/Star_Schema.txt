A star schema is a data modeling technique, primarily used in data warehousing, that organizes data into a central fact table surrounded by dimension tables.
This structure resembles a star, hence the name, and is designed to optimize query performance for analytical purposes. 


               +----------------+
               |  Time Dim      |
               +----------------+
                       |
+-----------+   +------+-----+   +----------------+
| Product   |---|  Fact Table |---| Customer Dim  |
| Dimension |   +------------+   +----------------+
                       |
               +----------------+
               |  Store Dim     |

You're analyzing sales data:

Fact Table: Contains how much was sold and when

Dimension Tables: Contain the "who, what, when, where":

Who bought it? → Customer

What was bought? → Product

When was it bought? → Time

Where was it bought? → Store
